;; Format a buffer containing GDScript code with the gdformat GDScript formatter.
;; This code is derived from gdtoolkit, see https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit

;;; Code:

(defun gdscript-format--format-region (start end)
  "Format the region between START and END using `gdformat'."
  (save-excursion
    (shell-command-on-region
     start end
     (concat
      "echo "
      (shell-quote-argument (buffer-substring start end))
      "|"
      gdscript-gdformat-executable " -")
     (buffer-name) t)))

(defun gdscript-format-region()
  "Format the selected region using `gdformat'"
  (interactive)
  (gdscript-format--format-region
   (region-beginning) (region-end)))

(defun gdscript-format-buffer()
  "Format the entire current buffer using `gdformat'"
  (interactive)
  (gdscript-format--format-region
   (point-min) (point-max)))
