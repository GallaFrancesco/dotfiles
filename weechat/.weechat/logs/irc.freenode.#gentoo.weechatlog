2020-10-30 12:27:13	bpkent	sokan: pretend to depclean a package to see what has deps on it (emerge -pvc <package>)
2020-10-30 12:27:37	bpkent	Jannik2099: equery d is not always accurate
2020-10-30 12:27:41	sokan	wine-staging. That makes sense
2020-10-30 12:28:25	sokan	bpkent: good idea as well
2020-10-30 12:28:45	sokan	bpkent: thing is that no package blocks openal deleting
2020-10-30 12:28:54	sokan	s/deleting/removal
2020-10-30 12:29:09	bpkent	sokan: is it in your world file?
2020-10-30 12:29:51	sokan	openal?
2020-10-30 12:29:56	sokan	not sure :S
2020-10-30 12:30:58	bpkent	sokan: ok, is openal already installed? or are you asking why is it about to be added to your system?
2020-10-30 12:31:07	sokan	the former
2020-10-30 12:32:09	bpkent	sokan: if nothing has deps on it, and it's not listed in, emerge -ac, then it's likely in your world file, if you don't want it, emerge --deselect openal && emerge -ac
2020-10-30 12:32:27	sokan	bpkent: got it :)

2020-11-04 09:30:38	ratrace	also, loadavg is poor limiter for emerge. many packages can start light (preprocessing, downloading, blah) and then later ramp up parallel compilation (which increases loadavg), while emerge is only considering it when _starting_ a new package.
2020-11-04 09:32:43	ajak	(but keep in mind make and emerge both have their own --load-average option)

2020-11-04 09:35:45	Aliekezhi	ratrace, for 8 cores, it should be 0.9*8 to load 90% ? Does it apply also if I'm already using -j4 ?

2020-11-04 09:37:16	ratrace	I don't know how loadavg combines with -j . and there's no guarantee setting any value of it will actually translate to that much of CPU capacity used
2020-11-04 09:38:31	ratrace	I really wouldn't worry about that. You have two options here, imo. One, give it all cores, two: give it something like half so you know you'll always have half the cores for other work and it won't mess with you using the computer.
2020-11-04 09:38:59	ratrace	Also important to consider, but there's no single equation for decision, how large -j is too large due to RAM constraints

2020-11-04 09:46:20	alarig	 *  Downgrading glibc is not supported and a sure way to destruction.
2020-11-04 09:46:33	alarig	Is it really a bad idea to downgrade glibc ?
2020-11-04 09:46:38	blaise	yes
2020-11-04 09:47:03	alarig	I can’t build a new module with the glibc from last night

2020-11-04 09:47:15	ionen	yes it's bad, it's not kidding about this
2020-11-04 09:47:22	alarig	So I really need to downgrade it
2020-11-04 09:47:37	blaise	no, you really need to wait out the storm till the bug is fixed
2020-11-04 09:48:02	alarig	arf
2020-11-04 09:48:12	alarig	(and I can’t upgrade to 4.19 or 5.4 because IPv6 is nearly broken on thoses)
2020-11-04 09:48:42	alarig	It should be fixed on 5.8, but I didn’t tried it yet
2020-11-04 09:49:17	blaise	I recommend using sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-bin-5.9.3
2020-11-04 09:49:27	blaise	till this issue is resolved
2020-11-04 09:49:52	ionen	is your currently built kernel an issue? could just stick with it for a bit to see how things go

2020-11-04 09:51:18	alarig	I just wanted to add a module
2020-11-04 09:51:23	ionen	ah
2020-11-04 09:53:58	ionen	guess I'll try giving 4.14.203 a build just to see
2020-11-04 09:54:12	blaise	I cannot recreate the issue reported with that version of glibc using gcc-10.2.0-r2 and any kernel in the linux-5.x tree
