2020-10-27 10:27:46	alphaglosined	Sun did everything in their power to make Java easy to use
2020-10-27 10:28:07	alphaglosined	don't blame a programmers choice on the maker of a tool ;)

2020-10-27 10:50:44	opDispatch	you can run this alphaglosined, like everyday routine ?
2020-10-27 10:51:04	alphaglosined	oh I'm not gonna try
2020-10-27 10:52:16	opDispatch	ahah let's see. The big thing is that at some point it will have to run on a gitlab runner too
2020-10-27 10:53:44	feep[work]	opDispatch: there was like an hour of confusion, lol
2020-10-27 10:53:53	feep[work]	what the fuck is .call, what the hell is this variable colliding with?!"
2020-10-27 10:53:57	feep[work]	"*
2020-10-27 10:54:11	feep[work]	I was going through pragma(msg)ing all the mixins, but I wasn't seeing a "call" variable anywhere
2020-10-27 10:54:22	feep[work]	I thought it was doing introspection over parameter names...
2020-10-27 10:54:50	feep[work]	eventually I noticed that weird-ass is ... == __parameters thing and got suspicious :)
2020-10-27 10:55:55	opDispatch	yeah very nice bug
2020-10-27 11:01:02	opDispatch	alphaglosined: ahah let's not see
2020-10-27 11:03:43	opDispatch	it should not be so hard to generate a railroad diagram from a grammar and I have an old unused SVG compatible canvas to help.
2020-10-27 11:05:17	opDispatch	and if mine is not good enough there's also one in arsd, if i remember correctly what happened two yaers ago
2020-10-27 11:10:23	opDispatch	The big problem with dot is the lack of control on the layout
